Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute Coral Reef Data Repository

Welcome to the Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) Coral Reef Data Repository, hosted on GitHub and administered by Dr. Juliet Karisa, a senior scientist at KMFRI. This repository serves as a central hub for the collection, storage, and dissemination of coral reef data pertinent to Kenya’s marine ecosystems.

The repository aims to support research, conservation efforts, and policy-making by providing open access to high-quality, peer-reviewed data sets. These include but are not limited to geographical information of reef locations, water quality indicators, coral bleaching events, and species biodiversity indices.

Researchers, conservationists, and policymakers are encouraged to utilize this data to foster collaborative efforts towards sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems in Kenya. Contributions to this repository are welcome, provided they adhere to our data submission guidelines and quality standards.

For any inquiries or assistance with the data, please contact Dr. Juliet Karisa directly via the contact information provided within this repository. We hope this resource empowers your research and conservation initiatives, enhancing the collective understanding and preservation of Kenya’s invaluable coral reefs.
